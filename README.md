# Object Oriented Programming Challenge

## This app takes data entered into node inquirer and creates cards for team members in a work team environment.
* The project creates an employee object 
* It extends the employee object with three other objects: Manager, Engineer, and Intern
* Each of these objects has tests written in Jest to confirm that they have been instantiated properly

## This app uses inquirer to populate the HTML page with information about each team member
* There are separate questions for managers, engineers, and interns
* Each of these responses is them pushed into one of three arrays: eon for manager, one for engineers and one for interns
* The responses are then written into an HTML file with the .map method using a template literal
